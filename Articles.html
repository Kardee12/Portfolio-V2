                                    <p>Usually, during a difficult time such as the one we are facing today, you would expect companies to be lax toward employees, as they have to deal with family and work. While that is the case for some companies, other
                                        companies have been reported to act differently towards their employees. According to CNET, this problem is currently prominent in the tech industry. A poll conducted by the Harris Poll for job site Glassdoor states
                                        that 28% of all adults from multiple industries state that their employer "has done nothing in response to concerns of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak". Only 16% of those surveyed got additional pay or sick leave.
                                        Some employees have stated that due to an inadequate response, they are still expected to work hard the whole day, as was the case before COVID-19.&nbsp; Managers and employees have also become critical of those
                                        trying to split time between their family and their job, as they are dissatisfied of how other employees can get time off. 45% of 1000 people surveyed by Care.com stated that their career progression suffered due
                                        to the hardship of work/family balance. However, there are companies such as Uber and Apple, who have emphasized flexibility in schedules, and more communication with managers/ the company in case more time is needed.
                                        Mental health services have even been called to help in some areas, which show the importance companies place on their employees’ well being. Hopefully, the initiative taken by these companies will be properly enforced
                                        during this time of crisis, so that workers will not have to deal with a lot of stress.<br></p><strong>Article Sources:<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/tech-firms-face-growing-resentment-toward-parent-employees-during-covid-19/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://www.cnet.com/news/tech-firms-face-growing-resentment-toward-parent-employees-during-covid-19/</span></a><br><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ubers-created-policies-to-protect-parents-and-caregivers-stuck-at-home-during-coronavirus/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://www.cnet.com/news/ubers-created-policies-to-protect-parents-and-caregivers-stuck-at-home-during-coronavirus/</span></a><br></strong></div>

                                <p>It has been nearly a year since iOS 13, the last major software update for Apple devices, was released. That means it might be time for the newest rendition to be released within the coming months. The newest version, iOS
                                    14, was revealed on June 22 at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, which was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One question that everyone will be asking is: what key features will this update have? A new
                                    feature known as App Library will arrange, by itself, your apps, in order to lower the messiness shown that you might have if you have many pages worth of apps. Another feature made for organization is being able to
                                    caption photos and videos, so you can easily search for it and be able to remember details when looking back. Another feature is that you will also be able to pin conversations at the top of the iMessage app.&nbsp;
                                    These are only a few of the features expected to be released with iOS 14 this fall, and if you are willing to take the risks of bugs and early issues, but also have a chance to experience the new features early, there
                                    is a public beta expected to come in July.<br></p>

                                <p>In computing news, popular graphic and chip unit company Nvidia is about to complete the $40 billion deal in which they planned to purchase ARM, another hardware firm which specializes in designing chips, from Japanese
                                    multinational conglomerate SoftBank. SoftBank has not been able to put the company into its maximum potential. Nvidia might be able to change and dominate the chip industry with this deal. This is huge news for the
                                    tech industry as well, as ARM technology has been implemented in a wide assortment of products, such as cars, data centers, and phones, according to DigitalTrends. Intel and AMD will need to catch up to their fellow
                                    competitor if they want to start having constant market control, after the finalization of this deal. A great case of this would be Intel’s CPU purpose. They are designed for single-threaded applications, according
                                    to VentureBeat. Nvidia’s GPUs , although separate from CPUs, have been designed for general purposes, proving that Intel will have to expand its market/product support if it wants to rise the ranks with Nvidia.<br></p><strong>Sources.<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-buying-arm/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-buying-arm/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong></div>

                            <p>As you might have heard, the new generation of consoles are expected to come this holiday season. Generally for the current generation of consoles, the PS4 has been regarded to be stronger than the Xbox One, in terms of graphics
                                and exclusives. However, this might not be the case for the future.Let’s take a look back. When you compare the Xbox One X to the PS4 Pro, both of which are the premium versions of the respective current-gen&nbsp; consoles,
                                the Xbox One X has superior stats. According to a comparison chart by Digital Trends, the Xbox One X has a CPU that is 2.3 GHz, and a GPU that is 6 teraflops, compared to the Playstation’s 2.1GHz CPU and 4.2 teraflop GPU.
                                The Xbox has 4K UHD Blu-ray, unlike the Playstation. However, the Series X was priced $100 higher than the Pro at launch, and was launched a year later than the&nbsp; PS4 Pro, in 2017. This is the opposite of what happened
                                when both consoles originally launched in 2013, when they had similar stats, but the Xbox was priced $100 higher, due to having a mandatory motion camera that was not regarded well.&nbsp;The trend of Xbox being technologically
                                superior continues on with the Xbox Series X and the PS5. Compared to the PS5, the Series X has a stronger CPU, at 3.8 GHz, a stronger GPU, at 12 teraflops, and larger SSD, which is a custom NVME 1TB model. However, the
                                question does not lie purely in hardware. Exclusives are also a huge draw towards a console. Playstation has had more popular exclusives during this generation compared to Xbox. This is not to say that Xbox exclusives are
                                bad, because there are well-regarded titles from both consoles, but you have a higher chance of drawing people towards a specific console with more exclusive games. If Xbox does not produce more exclusive titles, PlayStation
                                may have a chance at taking the crown at launch again.<br></p>
